# HomeAssistant Configuration Backup

This is my personal configuration backup repository for my home automation system using [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)

## General Approach

I'm still working through how I want things to be organized but packages are definitely going to be the way forward.

## Projects of note:

- NodeMCU (ESP8266) MQTT controlled horizontal plantation blinds <http://www.cribbstechnologies.com/index.php/home-automation/horizontal-plantation-blind-automation/>
- Wemos MQTT controlled doorbell and sensor node <http://www.cribbstechnologies.com/index.php/home-automation/mqtt-integrated-doorbell/>
- Wemos MQTT sensor node - page not done yet

## Device List:

- Raspberry Pi 3 running Home Assistant
- Aeotec Z-stick gen 5 for Z-wave integration
- Asus Dark Knight router running AsusWRT for presence detection
- Loads of Z-wave GE/Jasco Switches
- Loads of Z-wave GE/Jasco Lights
- GE/Jasco Z-wave fan controllers
- Sonoff switches running alternate firmware
- Various ESP8266 nodes collecting sensor data and controlling various automations
- Amazon Kindle Fire 7 tablet running [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan)
- Open Sprinker Pi [OpenSprinkler](opensprinkler.org)
- Amazon Dash buttons

## Future Projects:

- Create and install more sensors nodes around the house
- Custom Fire 7 mounts (in progress)
- convert old home alarm system to sensor nodes
- Garage controller and vehicle sensor

There's probably more stuff I forgot about. Go ahead and snoop around!
