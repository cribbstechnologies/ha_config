  IntroductionIntent:
    speech:

      text: >
        Hello! I'm Alexa. I can control various things around this house.
        For example, I can turn on the kitchen lights.
        Give it a shot. Say "Alexa, turn the kitchen light on".
        There are also various buttons around the house. 
        To find out what they control just say 
        "Alexa, ask the house about the (read the label) button".
        Things can also be controlled by the tablet near the garage door.
        Pressing the picture of the item you would like to control will toggle it.
        You can press the video cameras to get a still picture of what that camera sees.
  DashButtonIntent:

        {%- if button_name.lower() == 'milkbone' or button_name.lower() == 'milk bone' -%}
          This button controls the irrigation system in the back yard. 
          It's meant to be used after the dogs come in from using the bathroom to dilute the urine so the grass doesn't burn.
        {%- elif button_name.lower() == 'starbucks doubleshot' -%}
          This button helps start the day. It turns on the lights in the back yard, and a few lights downstairs to help get the dogs outside.
        {%- elif button_name.lower() == 'on' -%}
          This button turns off all of the lights in the house that aren't associated with automations.
        {%- else -%}
          I don't know about the {{button_name}} button
